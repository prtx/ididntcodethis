# Prompt 001: Repository Creation

**Creation Prompt for the Cursor Agent Model:**

"Hi there! I'd like you to create a README file for a new repository called 'I Didn't Code This.' This repo will showcase projects built entirely through AI collaboration, without me doing any manual coding.

In the README, please include:

* An introduction that explains the purpose of the repository.

* A folder structure section that outlines the basic layout of the repo.

Also, alongside the README, please create an `index.html` file. This `index.html` will serve as the home page when viewed on GitHub Pages, and it should introduce the overall 'I Didn't Code This' project in a simple, friendly way.

Finally, a folder called 'prompts' that will contain all the AI prompts used to create each project with numeric ids to track, including this very prompt.

Thanks!"
