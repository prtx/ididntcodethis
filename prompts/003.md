"Hi! I'd like you to create all 13 individual game implementations for the Arcade Hub project. Each game should be a fully functional, playable HTML file that uses the common `styles.css` stylesheet for consistent design.

Please create the following game files in the `projects/arcade-hub/` directory:

1. `number-wordle.html` - A number guessing game similar to Wordle
2. `classic-wordle.html` - The classic 5-letter word guessing game
3. `tic-tac-toe.html` - Classic 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe (with AI opponent)
4. `hangman.html` - Word guessing game with hangman drawing
5. `minesweeper.html` - Classic Minesweeper game
6. `snake.html` - Classic Snake game with arrow key controls
7. `memory-match.html` - Card matching memory game
8. `connect-four.html` - Connect Four game (with AI opponent)
9. `sudoku.html` - Sudoku puzzle with number input
10. `blackjack.html` - Blackjack card game
11. `pong.html` - Classic Pong game
12. `simon-says.html` - Simon Says sequence memory game
13. `chess.html` - Full chess game with move validation

Each game should:
- Use the existing `styles.css` for consistent styling
- Include a "Back to Arcade Hub" link that returns to `index.html`
- Be fully playable and functional
- Have a clean, user-friendly interface
- Work well on both desktop and mobile devices

Make sure each game is complete and ready to play! Thanks!
