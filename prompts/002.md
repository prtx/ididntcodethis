# Prompt 002: Arcade Hub Project

**Prompt for Cursor Agent Mode:**

"Hi! I'd like you to create a project called 'Arcade Hub' to be hosted on GitHub Pages. Arcade Hub is a simple static website that will serve as a central hub for multiple small games.

Here's what I need:

1. **Overview**: Arcade Hub is a GitHub Pages site that will list and link to the following games:

   * Number Wordle

   * Classic Wordle

   * Tic-Tac-Toe

   * Hangman

   * Minesweeper

   * Snake

   * Memory Match

   * Connect Four

   * Sudoku

   * Blackjack

   * Pong

   * Simon Says

   * Chess

2. **Home Page**: Create an `index.html` file that introduces Arcade Hub and lists each of these games with a brief description and a link to play.

3. **Common Style**: Use a common base template or style sheet so all games have a consistent look and feel.

4. **Navigation**: Ensure that the main `index.html` page allows easy navigation to each individual game.

In summary, Arcade Hub is a central site that brings together all these small games, including chess, under one cohesive design. Thanks!"
