# Prompt 004: Football Lineup Builder

**Prompt for Cursor Agent Mode:**

"Hi! I'd like you to build a football starting lineup builder as a new project. Here are the details:

1. **Purpose**: Create a web-based tool that allows users to design a football (soccer) starting lineup by selecting players from a database.

2. **Data Source**: Use the API-Football API to fetch player data. I'll provide the API key via my GitHub Workflows configuration, so you can assume it will be available securely as an environment variable.

3. **Features**:

   * Allow users to choose a formation (e.g., 4-4-2, 4-3-3, etc.).

   * Let users select players for each position from a list of players fetched via the API.

   * Display player names and optionally small player photos if available.

   * Allow users to save or share their lineup once it's created.

4. **Design**: Make the interface simple and user-friendly, with a grid or football pitch layout to show the formation.

5. **Output**: Once the lineup is created, let users export or share it as an image or a link.

In summary, please build a complete starting lineup builder that uses the API-Football data and assumes the API key will be available in the environment. Thanks!"
