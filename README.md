# I Didn't Code This

## Introduction

Welcome to **I Didn't Code This**! This repository is a unique collection of projects that were built entirely through AI collaboration. Every line of code, every design decision, and every implementation detail was created through conversations with AI assistants—no manual coding was involved in the creation of these projects.

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Showcase the capabilities of AI-assisted development
- Demonstrate how AI can be used to build complete, functional projects
- Document the creative process through the prompts that guided each project
- Inspire others to explore AI collaboration in their own development journey

Each project in this repository comes with its own documentation, including the prompts that were used to create it, so you can see exactly how AI collaboration made it possible.
